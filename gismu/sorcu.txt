sorcu - soc, sro
x1 is a store/deposit/supply/reserve of materials/energy x2 in containment x3.

$x_3$ need not be a container, but could merely be a site/location restriction; e.g. a heap.  The sumti indicates how the supply is identified and distinguished from other occurrences of the stored $x_2$ that are not part of the store.  (cf. {panka}; {vreji} for information storage; {sabji} for a store or reserve that is not necessarily tied to a site, {banxa}, {panka})
