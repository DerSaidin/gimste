Definition: x1 is a story/tale/yarn/narrative about plot/subject/moral x2 by storyteller
  x3 to audience x4.
Notes: Also legend; a narrative need not be fictional; $x_2$ may be merely a convention
  rather than a subject; also $x_3$ tells/recounts story/tale $x_1$ about $x_2$ to
  $x_4$ (= {selterlisri} for place reordering); note that the storyteller need not
  be the author.  See also {ranmi}, {cfika}, {skicu}, {prosa}, {pemci}.
