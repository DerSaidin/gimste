Word: cirko
Rafsi: cri
Definition: x1 loses person/thing x2 at/near x3; x1 loses property/feature x2 in conditions/situation
  x3.
Notes: $x_2$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event (rare for cirko),
  or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from
  ownership of the object/commodity (= {po'ecri}, {posyselcri} for unambiguous semantics).  See
  also {facki}, {ralte}, {sisku}, {claxu}, {jinga}, {pleji}, {canja}, {sfasa}, {dapma},
  {binra}, {mipri}.
