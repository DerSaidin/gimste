Definition: x1 answers/replies to/responds to person/object/event/situation/stimulus
  x2 with response x3.
Notes: $x_3$ also answer/reply.  If $x_2$ is a person/object, it will usually require
  "tu'a" indicating that the reply/response is to that person/object doing something.  "tu'a"
  may not be needed if the person/object itself is the stimulus, rather than something
  it is doing. See also {cusku}, {preti}, {nabmi}, {danfu}, {frati}, {cpedu}.
