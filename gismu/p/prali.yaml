Word: prali
Rafsi: pal
Definition: x1 is a profit/gain/benefit/advantage to x2 accruing/resulting from activity/process
  x3.
Notes: Also (fe) $x_2$ profits from $x_3$ (= {selterprali} for reordered places);
  $x_1$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property; pedantically,
  for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity
  (= {selposprali} for unambiguous semantics).  See also {vecnu}, {cnemu}, {pleji},
  {jinga}, {canja}, {sfasa}, {jerna}, {jdima}, {dunda}, {zivle}.
