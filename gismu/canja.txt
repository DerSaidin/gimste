Notes:
Also (adjective:) $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_4$ is/are commercial (better expressed as ka canja, {kamcanja}).  $x_2$/$x_3$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event (possibly service), or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posycanja} for unambiguous semantics); (cf. {dunda}, {friti}, {vecnu}, {zarci}, {jdini}, {pleji}, {jdima}, {jerna}, {kargu}; see note at {jdima} on cost/price/value distinction, {banxa}, {cirko}, {dunda}, {janta}, {kargu}, {prali}, {sfasa}, {zivle})
