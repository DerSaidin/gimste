Word: vamji
Rafsi: vam, va'i
Definition: x1 (ni) is the equivalent value/worth of x2 [item(s) of value] to x3 for
  use/appreciation x4.
Notes: 'Also: $x_2$ is worth $x_1$ to $x_3$; (for $x_2$ person:) $x_2$ merits (one
  sense), (adjective:) $x_2$ is worthy (= selva''i for reordered places); merit reward
  (= {nemselva''i}); receive merited reward (= {vamselne''u}); $x_2$ may be a specific
  object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities,
  this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posyva''i}, {posyselva''i}
  for unambiguous semantics).  (cf. {jdima}, {jerna}, {vecnu}, {dirba}, {janta}, {kargu},
  {pleji}; see note at jdima on cost/price/value distinction, {vajni})'
