Definition: x1 (object/commodity/property/event) is costly/expensive/dear to x2 by
  standard x3.
Notes: $x_1$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property;
  pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the
  object/commodity (= {poskargu} for unambiguous semantics).  See also {vamji}, {dirba},
  {vajni}, {jdima}, {pleji}, {canja}, {jerna}, {jinga}, {jemna}, {sfasa}, {vecnu}.
Examples: None
