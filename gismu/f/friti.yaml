Word: friti
Rafsi: fit
Definition: x1 offers/proffers x2 [offering] to x3 with conditions x4.
Notes: ($x_4$ may be nu canja, nu pleji, etc.; an unconditional offering has the 'condition'
  of acceptance); $x_2$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or
  a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership
  of the object/commodity (= {posfriti}, {posyselfriti} for unambiguous semantics).  See
  also {canja}, {dunda}, {rinsa}, {vecnu}, {jdima}, {cnemu}, {pleji}, {vitke}.
Examples: None
