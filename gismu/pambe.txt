pambe - 
x1 is a pump/injector [tool/apparatus] pumping/inserting fluid x2 to x3 from x4 by means x5.

$x_2$ fluid may be liquid or gas; $x_5$ may be a force; a pump generally causes a pressure gradient, such that $x_3$ is a place of lower pressure, $x_4$ a place of higher pressure.  (cf. {gapci}, {litki}, {rinci}; metaphorical use of {fepri} for gas, {risna} for liquid, {rinci}, {tutci})
