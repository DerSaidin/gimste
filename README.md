=========

This project aims to facilitate a cooperative effort to audit, and revise where necessary, the many definitions
of the lojban lexicon. The project will initially focus on the gimste, or gismu list. Afterwards, other efforts
may be made to improve other parts of the jbovlaste.


The Process
-----------

The process is yet to be clearly defined but should administrative needs become apparent we can work them out
then. For now, we will simply begin the work. Below is some basic guidelines for participating.


Questions?
----------

Any questions should be directed to the community on Freenode IRC. You can connect by visting http://webchat.freenode.net
