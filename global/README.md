This folder will list the global proposals (ones that apply to many gismu).

In order to be lazy about creating the PR, the proposals will just be represented
by a text file in this folder describing the change. Discussion and voting
will happen on the PR, and then accepted proposals will be applied afterwards
(presumably by someone proficient in the use of `grep`).

In the web interface, you can add a file by clicking the "+" button above
(next to "gimste / global /").
