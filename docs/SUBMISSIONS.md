We will be using github to manage the balningau process. This will allow us a
lot of control over how changes are organized, reviewed,
and finally merged/commited as accepted changes.

In order to create your own change proposals you will need to have an account
on github.com (and it will help if you are familiar with git). This document
will give some basic guidelines to submitting a change proposal but if you
get stuck you can always seek help or advice from people on IRC.

How to submit a proposed change:
--------------------------------

Every proposed gismu change should be submitted individually.

The general outline for submitting a change proposal is as follows:

  1. Click a gismu text file
  2. Click the edit button
  3. Apply your changes to the file
  4. Click *Propose Change*
  5. Edit the *Pull Request* and defend your change


Selecting a file to change:
---------------------------

Firstly, ensure that you are logged in with your own github user. Then visit
the repository online by visiting the following link:

https://github.com/balningau/gimste


You should see a listing of the files inside the gimste repo:

By clicking on the `gismu` folder, you will see a listing of all the gismu
organized alphabetically. Let's assume we want to make a change to `traji` so
 we will open the `t` folder:
