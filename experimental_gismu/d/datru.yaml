    notes:
    - We felt that {detri} just didn't work as a culturally-independent date system.
      The use of {pi'e} or {joi} as date mechanisms was insufficient and having the
      date components built into the place structure seems far more elegant. (Cf.
      {masti}, {djedi}, {nanca}, {nu}, {fasnu}, {purci}, {balvi}, {jeftu})
    glosses:
    - happen (on day)
    - x2=day (on day)
    - x3=month (of month)
    - x4=year (of year)
    - x5=calendar (date chart)
  zh:
    place structure: x1（事件）发生在/处于时间日期x2，月份x3，年份x4，以历法x5
    notes:
    - '{detri}是不能够表示某些独立的时间系统的，{pi''e}或{joi}的使用也存在不足，而将时间元素构建到位结构之中又显得非常繁杂；参见 {masti},
      {djedi}, {nanca}, {nu}, {fasnu}, {purci}, {balvi}, {jeftu})'
