    place structure: x1 is aligned diagonally along/between nonadjacent vertices x2
      as in polytope x3; x1 is a diagonal line segment/linear manifold of lower dimension
      as viewed in frame of reference x3; x1 is crooked (one sense), skew (one sense,
      see notes), off-kilter (one sense), away from center/off-center, non-orthogonal/not
      perpendicular nor parallel, at an angle, perhaps non-vertical and non-horizontal,
      diagonal to x2 in figure/coordinate system x3.
    notes:
    - 'Not for use in: entries of tensors/matrices (confer: {daigno}), certain geometric
      meanings (such as with Cartesian products), etc.  Only for purely ''visual''
      geometric objects/figures/frames. The polytope in question need not actually
      be ''drawn''; an oriented frame of reference naturally ''projects'' a polytopic
      sense onto all objects.'

    - x1 can be any linear manifold of lower dimension than the space in which it
      is embedded (defined by x3).
    - ''
    - The skewness is not relative to another linear manifold in some higher-dimensional
      space (the usual definition of "skew" in geometry) - it is simply a skewness
      (in a layperson sense) relative to points in a figure or axis in a coordinate
      system.

    glosses:
    - at an angle (diagonally, visual geometric)
    - crooked (diagonally, visual geometric)
    - diagonal (of a polytope; geometric (one sense))

    place structure: x1 est une diagonale segment qui relie deux sommets non-consécutifs
      x2 (non reliés par un côté) de la polygone/dans référentiel x3
    notes:
    - Ne pas utiliser ce mot pour les matrices (cf. {daigno}).
