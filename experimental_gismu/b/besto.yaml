    place structure: x1 dons metaphorical asbestos suit x2 to guard against flames
      x3 on topic x4 from x5, who disagrees with post x6 for reason x7, not realizing
      that the post was meant to be sent to x8 rather than all of mailing list x9
      (default jboste) where it was posted in response to email  x10, whose author
      wishes selma'o  x11 (default SE) were extended to concisely express place  x12
      of brivla  x13 (default Besto) which has place structure  x14 and too many places
      because of sadistic whim  x15 of brivla-maker  x16, who also created brivla  x17
      which has place structure  x18, and so winds up using too many of cmavo  x19
      (default zi'o) in order to make the brivla ( x13) more usable by standard  x20
      and wishes they had never heard of the word besto for reason  x21, not realizing
      for reason  x22 that it was suggested sarcastically due to boredom  x23 of person  x24,
      who is proposing it against better judgement  x25 because it is fun by standard  x26,
      but still wishes it had as many places as  x27 (default du) for reason  x28,
      and feels like throwing in epistemology sumti  x29, because he/she knows both
      that gismu  x30 (default besto) has its place structure defined by run-on sentence  x31
      and that epistemology sumti are used in gismu  x32 by epistemology  x33, notwithstanding
      the fact that  x34 actually has a use for besto places  x35 (default 1) through  x36
      (default x7) and wishes this weren't an extremely long and stupid joke, longer
      than joke  x37 and stupider than joke  x38 but still appreciated by  x39 - a
      fact which says  x40 about them in the opinion of  x41 - but not seen as even
      remotely amusing by  x42, who is aware that  x43 has a use for the gismu besto
      because of  x45
    notes:
    - A joke gismu from http://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=besto . Place x44 is
      absent for some reason

    place structure: x1穿上具有隐喻性质的石棉防护服x2，抵抗/防止火焰/焦点x3，在x4上燃烧/焦点的主题是x4，来自x5，他不同意发布信息x6，因为x7，却没意识到此海报本来是要发给x8而不是发给x9（默认jboste），在那里信息被发布以回应邮件x10，邮件的作者希望结构词类x11（默认SE）能被扩展到能简明地表达x12位，该位属于brivla
      x13（默认besto），其具有位结构x14和许多的位，因为一股施虐的心血来潮x15从brivla制造者x16的脑中汹涌而出，这个制造者还制造了brivla
      x17，其位结构为x18，使用了许多cmavo x19（默认zi'o）对此brivla进行加强，目的是为了使brivla x13更有用，当基于标准x20时，并且希望他们从未听说besto这个词，因为原因x21，却未意识到因为原因x22，它被讽刺挖苦般地提议出来，因为无聊x23，此无聊属于人x24，他/她建议以此更好地对抗评判x25，因为这是相当有趣的，基于标准x26，但他/她仍然希望它能拥有和x27（默认du）同样多的位，且似乎也搅和进基于认知伦的sumti
      x29之中了，因为他/她知道gismu x30（默认besto）有基于句子x31的位结构定义且被用于gismu x32中的认知论sumti是基于认知论x33使用的，尽管事实上x34有用于besto的位x35（默认1）到位x36（默认x7）的方法且希望这不会是过于地长而愚蠢的笑话，甚至比笑话x37还长，比笑话x38还蠢，但仍然受到了x39的喜爱——此笑话说关于他们的x40，基于x41的见解——但却像根本毫无趣味一样见不到，他倒是很清楚x43用过这个gismu
      besto，因为x45

    - 一个用于搞笑的 gismu， 来自 http://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=besto 注意：x44因为某种原因遗失了
